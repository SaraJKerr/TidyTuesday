# TidyTuesday

This repo contains my code for the __Tidy Tuesday__ project from __R4DS__, with the aim of experimenting with different types of visualisation.

## Week 1 - 23 July 2019
My first week of TidyTuesday uses the __Wildlife Strikes__ dataset from the _FAA_ (available from https://wildlife.faa.gov/).

For this visualisation I created a chloropleth map. This indicates that the southern coastal states of California, Texas, and Florida have the highest number of bird strikes.

## Week 2 - 30 July 2019
The dataset for this week of TidyTuesday is the __Video Games__ dataset from Liza Wood via _Steam Spy_ (blog available from https://cruiseofdimensionality.home.blog/2019/07/24/pc-video-games-we-still-play/).

This week I wanted to create two different types of visualisation. Firsly I wanted to try out the Economist theme from ggthemes. For the next visualisation I chose to experiment with a circular bar plot.

## Week 3 - 13 August 2019
This week's dataset is a throwback to my undergraduate degree in Ancient History - __Roman Emperors__. The dataset is from _Wikipedia_ and _Zonination_. I chose to explore creating an interactive treemap, using the _treemap_, _d3treeR_, and _htmlwidgets_ packages.
