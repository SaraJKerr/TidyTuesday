# TidyTuesday

This repo contains my code for the __Tidy Tuesday__ project from __R4DS__, with the aim of experimenting with different types of visualisation.

## Week 1 - 23 July 2019
My first week of TidyTuesday uses the __Wildlife Strikes__ dataset from the _FAA_ (available from https://wildlife.faa.gov/).

For this visualisation I created a chloropleth map. This indicates that the southern coastal states of California, Texas, and Florida have the highest number of bird strikes.
